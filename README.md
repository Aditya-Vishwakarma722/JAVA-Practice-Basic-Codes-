This repository contains my **basic Java codes** where I practice and explore different **core concepts of Java**.  
The goal of this repo is to **learn, experiment, and strengthen fundamentals** step by step. 🚀  

---

## 📌 Topics Covered (so far)  
- 🏗️ **Classes & Objects** – Understanding object-oriented basics  
- ⚡ **Constructors** – Default & Parameterized initialization  
- 🎭 **Abstraction** – Abstract classes and methods  
- 🔄 **Inheritance** – Reusing code through parent-child relationships  
- 🎭 **Polymorphism** – Method overloading & overriding  
- 🔒 **Encapsulation** – Data hiding with getters/setters  
- 🧩 **Interfaces** – Contracts for implementing multiple behaviors  
- 💡 *(More concepts will be added as I learn!)*  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- ☕ **Java** (Core Concepts)  
- 🖥️ IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code / Eclipse  
- 🔧 Tools: Git & GitHub for version control  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
✔️ Build a strong foundation in **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**  
✔️ Learn through small, focused code examples  
✔️ Keep a personal reference library of Java concepts  

---

## 🚀 Future Plans  
- Add more **advanced OOP topics** (Generics, Inner Classes, etc.)  
- Explore **Collections Framework** (List, Set, Map, etc.)  
- Practice **Exception Handling** and **File Handling**  
- Prepare mini **cheat-sheets** for quick revision
