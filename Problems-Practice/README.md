# DSA Practice Folder

This folder contains my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice** in **Java**.  
It documents my problem-solving progress across platforms like **HackerRank, CodeChef, and LeetCode**.  

---

## Folder Structure

Each subfolder represents a DSA topic:-

arrays/ - Problems related to arrays
strings/ - Problems related to strings
linkedlist/ - Problems related to linked lists
stack/ - Problems related to stack
queue/ - Problems related to queue
recursion/ - Problems solved using recursion
searching/ - Problems using searching algorithms
sorting/ - Problems using sorting algorithms


Purpose :-
To practice and improve problem-solving skills systematically
To organize solutions by topic for clarity and learning
To maintain clean GitHub history and track progress
Focus is on understanding algorithms, optimizing code, and learning best practices

Notes :-
All code is written in Java 8+
This folder is educational, not a library — solutions may evolve with optimization and learning
